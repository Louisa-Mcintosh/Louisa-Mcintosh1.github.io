## About Me

Hello! I am **Louisa McIntosh**, a bioinformatician with a passion for analysing complex biological data to extract meaningful insights. I specialise in genomics, NGS data analysis, bioinformatics tools, and data visualisation. My goal is to contribute to the scientific community by transforming biological data into actionable knowledge.

## Skills

Here are the key skills and technologies that I have expertise in:

- **Programming**: Python, R, Bash
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: BLAST, GATK, Bioconductor
- **Data Visualisation**: Matplotlib, ggplot2
- **NGS Analysis**: RNA-Seq analysis, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
- **Machine Learning**: Used for protein structure prediction and other bioinformatics tasks
- **Bioinformatics Pipelines**: Created efficient pipelines for handling various NGS data analysis tasks

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. **RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline**: 
   - Built a Python-based pipeline to process and analyse RNA-Seq data. This project involved data quality control, alignment, differential gene expression analysis, and visualisation.
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Louisa-Mcintosh/Rna-seq-analysis-pipeline.git)


2. **Variant Analysis in WGS Data**:
   - Conducted variant calling and analysis using GATK on whole-genome sequencing data, followed by visualisation of the findings with R.
